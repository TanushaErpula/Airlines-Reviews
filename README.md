# Comprehensive Analysis of Airline Customer Sentiment Using Data Analytics and Visualization Tools

## Introduction

The airline industry is highly competitive, and customer satisfaction is crucial for success. This project focuses on analyzing airline customer reviews to understand sentiment, identify trends, and provide actionable insights. Using Python for data processing and sentiment analysis, alongside Tableau for data visualization, this analysis aims to translate raw data into meaningful insights that can guide airline stakeholders.

## Dataset Overview

### Source of Data

The dataset consists of reviews and ratings provided by customers across various airlines. It includes thousands of entries, each representing a customer's experience.

### Key Features in the Dataset

- **Review Text**: Qualitative feedback provided by customers.
- **Rating**: A numerical score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
- **Airline Name**: The airline associated with the review.
- **Sentiment**: Derived sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) from the review text using NLP techniques.

### Data Preparation

Data cleaning was a critical step, involving handling missing values, removing duplicates, and text normalization. This ensured the dataset was ready for accurate analysis.

## Data Processing and Analysis in Jupyter Notebook

### 1. Data Cleaning

The dataset was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and errors. Steps included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing the review text.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis was performed to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. This involved tokenization, vectorization, and applying a sentiment analysis model.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved summarizing the dataset's main characteristics, using visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships. Key activities included analyzing rating distribution, sentiment distribution, common themes, and correlation analysis.

## Data Visualization in Tableau

### 1. Sentiment Over Time

A timeline visualization tracked customer sentiment changes over time, identifying periods of significant improvement or decline.

### 2. Airline Performance Comparison

This analysis compared different airlines based on customer ratings and sentiment, highlighting industry leaders and laggards.

### 3. Heatmaps and Bar Charts

Heatmaps visualized review density across sentiment categories, and bar charts highlighted rating distributions by airline.

### 4. Word Clouds

Word clouds visualized the most commonly mentioned words in positive and negative reviews, revealing key areas of customer concern or satisfaction.

## Tableau Dashboard Overview

### 1. Interactive Dashboard Design

The Tableau dashboard provides an interactive experience, allowing users to explore data dynamically. It features dynamic filters, hover-over tooltips, and drill-down capabilities.

### 2. Key Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard includes:
- **Sentiment Timeline**: Shows sentiment evolution over time.
- **Airline Comparison Matrix**: Compares airlines based on ratings and sentiment.
- **Review Heatmap**: Displays review intensity across sentiment categories and airlines.

### 3. User Accessibility

Designed for user-friendliness, the dashboard is accessible to a wide range of stakeholders, from analysts to executives.

## Key Insights

- **Overall Trends**: The majority of reviews were positive, but customer service and in-flight amenities were areas of concern.
- **Airline Comparisons**: Some airlines consistently received higher ratings, while others need to focus on specific areas for improvement.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Identified periods where customer satisfaction dipped, allowing for proactive issue resolution.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of data analytics and visualization tools in analyzing airline customer sentiment. The Tableau dashboard offers a powerful tool for exploring data interactively, enabling data-driven decision-making. The insights gained are valuable for airlines looking to improve customer satisfaction and maintain a competitive edge.
